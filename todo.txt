TODO

- Implement hidden heuristic values (biases):
    = "Highest in Corner" DONE
- Implement new heuristic functions:
    = "Merging" (Higher value depending on tile value being merged)
- Tweak mono and smth functions:
    = Give more value/weight to higher tile values
    = Allow smth functions to work diagonally(?)
