# 2B0T48
Hi! This is my attempt at a 2048 AI, able to learn from user input and play based on what aspects of the game it finds most important.

It uses my own interpretation and implementation of Ovolve's heuristic functions to analyze and give a 2048 board value. It uses this value to figure out what move is best given what heuristics it finds most important.

To install required python libraries:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Make sure Python>=3.7 is installed and PIP3 is updated**
